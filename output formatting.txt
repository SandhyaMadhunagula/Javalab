Java's System.out.printf function can be used to print formatted output. The purpose of this exercise is to test your understanding of formatting output using printf.

To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor; you must format and print the input to complete the solution.

Input Format

Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
Each String will have a maximum of  alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from  to .

Output Format

In each line of output there should be two columns:
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly  characters.
The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly  digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.

Sample Input

java 100
cpp 65
python 50
Sample Output

================================
java           100 
cpp            065 
python         050 
================================

Solution:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("================================");
            for(int i=0;i<3;i++){
                String s1=sc.next();
                int x=sc.nextInt();
                //Complete this line
                System.out.printf("%-14s %03d\n",s1,x);
                
            }
            System.out.println("================================");

    }
}
