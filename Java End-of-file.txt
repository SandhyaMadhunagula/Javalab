The challenge here is to read  lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all  lines of content.
Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.
Input Format:
Read some unknown  lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.
Output Format:
For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.
Sample Input:

Hello world
I am a file
Read me until end-of-file.

Sample Output:

1 Hello world
2 I am a file
3 Read me until end-of-file.
