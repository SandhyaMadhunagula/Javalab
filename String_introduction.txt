String myString = "Hello World!"
The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.
Given two strings of lowercase English letters.A and B,perform the following operations:
1.Sum the lengths of  and .
2.Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B  come before A  in the dictionary?).
3.Capitalize the first letter in A and B  and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
Input Format
The first line contains a string A . The second line contains another string B. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.
Output Format
There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths  A of  and B.
For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically greater than B otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
Sample Input 0:

Sample Output 0:
